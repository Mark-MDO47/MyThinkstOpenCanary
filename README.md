# MyThinkstOpenCanary
My implementation of Thinkst OpenCanary on Raspberry Pi

- Based on the fantastic https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary
- Easy way to read the documentation is https://opencanary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Quick OtherMaker Youtube video about OpenCanary on Raspberry Pi is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RanpEQBvAY0

The concept of the Thinkst Canary is fantastic! I would love to have one or more, but they are outside my budget as an ordinary person and not a business.

Thinkst provided a path for ordinary folks like me (Thank You!!!) to get some of the benefits at low cost

Note that the YouTube points out that the sample configuration for Gmail alerts does not contain a comma at the end. I am not yet certain if this is required.
